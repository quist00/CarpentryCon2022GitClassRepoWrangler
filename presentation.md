## Why the tool exists
Short answer: FEAR! 

---

- Early pandemic
- Transitioned to teaching python over zoom in my own non-official workshops
- Stragegically avoided GIT module due to the complexity
- Then, Volunteered to co-teach full Software Carpentry Workshop. 

    -Even though I was only the helper for the GIT section, trying to do that remotely was a concern.  It was challenging enough in person.  I had a few weeks, so I tried to come up with some helper scripts

---

V0 was born.  It was a series of helper scripts in a jupyter/vs code file that I could run in the background as the helper. It worked well enough, but only because I wrote it and was running it. I wanted to make it shareable.

---

V1 was to convert it to a command line utility
- second test was great until the end
- was able to run it myself from the commandline as I taught the section

---

- only problem was what I call the phone booth problem, i.e. having 25 committers trying to commit on master simultaneously
