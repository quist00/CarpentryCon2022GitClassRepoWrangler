## Why the tool exists
Short answer: FEAR.  
- Early pandemic
- I transitioned to teaching python over zoom in my own on-official workshops
- Avoided GIT module due to the complexity
- volunteered to co-teach full Software Carpentry Workshop and even though I was only the helper for the GIT section, trying to do that section remotely was a concern.  It seemed hard enough in person.  I had a few weeks, so I tried to come up with some helper scripts
________________

V0 was born.  It was a series of helper scripts in a jupyter/vs code file that I could run in the background as the helper. It worked, but only because I wrote it and was running it.

--------
V1 was to convert it to a command line utility
- second test was great until the end
- was able to run it myeself from the commandline as I taught the section
- only problem was the phone booth problem, i.e. having 25 committers trying to commit on master simultaneously



# Demo
## Class command/checklist
 - edit roster to include class names
 - invite people to be collaborators ./gcrw invite
 - generate solo files ./gcrw files
 - have them clone the repo
 - generate conflict ./gcrw files --conflict
